Use Java and JDBC to write a program to simulate transfer money from one to another bank account 
(let user input account numbers and transfer amount). Note: in order to keep the balance of each 
bank account in a consistent status, use a transaction to process each money transfer (Put two 
update statements for transfer from and transfer to accounts in one transaction). Assume the 
bankaccount table exists already.


Use the following bankaccount schema.


create table bankaccount(accnum int primary key, balance real);



insert into bankaccount values(111,1000);



insert into bankaccount values(222,2000);


Please submit .java files. (JDBC Oracle example file is attached.)
