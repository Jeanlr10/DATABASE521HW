Transactions
The Setting
    Database Systems are normally being accessed by many users or processes at the same time
        Both Queries and modifications
    Unlike Operating Systems, which support interaction of processes, a DMBS needs to keep processes from troublesome interactions

Example: Bad interaction   
    You and your spouse each take $100 from different ATMs at about the same time
        The DBMS better make sure one account deduction doesn't get lost
    Compare: An OS allows two people to edit a document at the same time. If both write, one's changes are lost

Transactions
    A transaction is an action, or a series of actions, carried out by a single user or an application program, which reads or updates the contents of a database
    A transaction is a 'logical unit of work' on a database
        each transaction does something in the database
        No part of it alone achieves anything of use or interest
    Transactions are the unit of recovery, consistency, and integrity as well
    ACID properties
        Atomic - Either the whole process is done or none is
        Consistent - Database constraints are preserved
        Isolated - It appears to the user as if only one process executes at a time
        Durable - Effects of a process do not get lost if the system crashes

    Example of Transaction
        Transfer $50 from account A to account B
        A = A - 50
        Write(A)
        Read(B)
        B=B+50
        Write(B)

        Atomicity - Shouldnt take money from A without giving it to B
        Consistency - Money isn't lost or gained
        Isolation - Other queries shouldn't see A or B change until completion
        Durability - the money does not go back to A

The Transaction Manager
    The transaction manager enforces the ACID properties
        It schedules the operation of transactions
        COMMIT and ROLLBACK are used to ensure atomicity
        Locks or timestamps are used to ensure consistency and isolation for concurrent transactions
        A log is kept to ensure durability in the event of system failure
